# Hello Task Helper!
Task Helper can help you with your learn programming.
You can save your task, solution and description of your task.
Descripton is .txt file.
Solution is .exe file. (Compiled solution on Visual Studio or smth this)
Tasks, solutions and descriptions are saving in your own database, such as MySql or PostgeSql.
You can configure your own sounds.
Folder "temp" in "SimpleWork"is including pure sql without entity framework. It's not useful now.

I hope you this app can help someone <3
